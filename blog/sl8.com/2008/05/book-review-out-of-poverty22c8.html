  Out Of Poverty by Paul Polak
 <br /> 
 <br /> The author begins with a brief introduction of his farming experience with strawberries in his early years &amp; ties it back to how hard farming as a business is.
 <br /> 
 <div class="separator"> 
  <a href="https://static.squarespace.com/static/52a60bc7e4b00aedfa1f1c97/52a815bfe4b0a2f7dae8684a/52a815c0e4b0a2f7dae8690b/1386747328775/1000w/" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="https://static.squarespace.com/static/52a60bc7e4b00aedfa1f1c97/52a815bfe4b0a2f7dae8684a/52a815c0e4b0a2f7dae8690b/1386747328775/1000w/" /></a>
 </div> 
 <br /> The first chapter offers his 12 step common sense &amp; direct problem solving philosophy &amp; gives an insight into his simple but measurable approach.
 <br /> 
 <br /> He then opines the three myths that the west seems to suffer from about poverty eradication (Charity, Increasing national economic growth &amp; getting large multi-nationals to set up businesses in these countries) in the second chapter.
 <br /> 
 <br /> Author does a strong criticism on why massive global efforts such as UN's Millenium Development Goals with significant investments have failed as well as dissects CK Prahlad's &quot;Bottom of the Pyramid&quot;.
 <br /> 
 <br /> Chapter three covers why the author thinks the only way to eradicate poverty is by improving the agricultural income of &quot;less than an acre&quot; farms in a businesslike / market driven manner, &amp; introduces 'Krishna Bahadur Thapa', a poor Nepali farmer who is revisited almost in a case study like manner in the rest of the book.
 <br /> 
 <br /> Business &amp; design challenges in serving the &quot;base of the pyramid&quot; are covered next as he discusses affordability, lower initial investment, faster time to value &amp; offers successes such as Treadle pump, cheaper drip irrigation kit etc.
 <br /> 
 <br /> The author highlights how underserved some of these markets are. He then discusses design issues &amp; a &quot;don't bother&quot; trilogy about how not to design products for this customer base.
 <br /> 
 <br /> In an essay like manner, chapter five 'from subsistence to new income' continues with the 'Thapa' family &amp; their status quo situation. It touches upon why it is important to boost the income of entrepreneurs like him &amp; also includes a brief historic overview of grass root enterprises.
 <br /> 
 <br /> &quot;Affordable small plot irrigation&quot; continues with the &quot;Thapa&quot; story &amp; how the entire drip irrigation idea came to fruition. This interesting discourse demonstrates how ideas from frontline are nurtured, tested, prototyped &amp; implemented.
 <br /> 
 <br /> The author discusses this topic in context of other countries such as India, Bangladesh, Kenya, Zambia etc. &amp; highlights the need for solutions in this space.
 <br /> 
 <br /> Chapter seven is almost a product development / marketing lesson for these entrepreneurs, where he highlights how these farmers can get the &quot;most bang for their buck&quot; by growing crops that are labor intensive &amp; timing them to market for maximum returns.
 <br /> 
 <br /> He also talks about other innovations such as &quot;Monsoon Tomatoes&quot;, fertilizers / manures from animal &amp; human excreta, crop rotation &amp; integrated pest management. Channel management, marketing / distribution &amp; strategies to move up the value chain are covered next as he talks about day to day challenges with access to marketplaces, market inefficiencies, lack of knowledge &amp; information on alternatives for trading the produce items.
 <br /> 
 <br /> The author explains how to create channels &amp; mutually beneficial parties to market &amp; promote products &amp; services for this segment.
 <br /> 
 <br /> He cites few pertinent examples such as decentralized (on site) processing of Brazil Nuts to organic Pineapple trades where other non profits have achieved success.
 <br /> 
 <br /> Slums are covered next as the author talks about Dharavi in India. He discusses their socio-economic impact &amp; how they can be potential incubators for new opportunities. He cites an example of Neerja International, which trained Jaipur slum pottery manufacturers to create blue pottery &amp; has successfully commercialized it. He elaborates on how these entrepreneurs can be supported.
 <br /> 
 <br /> Chapter 10 transitions from social aspects of sustainability to the environmental impacts &amp; makes a case for how poverty eradication assists with sustainability in terms of biodiversity, global warming, population growth, health &amp; education, and espouses the author's grander vision of how other seemingly unrelated problems that we face today are related to poverty.
 <br /> 
 <br /> &quot;Taking action to end poverty&quot; is a call to arms where the author suggests what we all can do for poverty eradication. He discusses macroeconomic &amp; global policy level changes to ensure fairness of UNDP assistance &amp; to prevent corruption / misuse of funds.
 <br /> 
 <br /> He also explains what we what we all can do as individuals, poor people, institutions (Universities, Not For Profits), Multi-Nationals, Designers &amp; introduces his next organization, D-Rev or design revolution.
 <br /> 
 <br /> The final chapter ends on a bitter sweet note as it informs the reader of sudden demise of &quot;Krishna Bahadur Thapa&quot;. In a case study like manner, the author does a comprehensive job of explaining just how incredible is the economic success of the &quot;Thapa&quot; family as it moves out of poverty. He acknowledges that while this is not typical, it is exemplary &amp; inspirational of what others below the poverty line can strive for.
 <br /> 
 <br /> Criticism:
 <br /> 
 <br /> 1. Author does not cover how he made the transition from being a psychiatrist to creating IDE. This makes it harder to understand how one can participate in this cause, even if one wanted to.
 <br /> 
 <br /> 2. While the book is a great food for thought, it seems to be more focused on the destination rather than the journey. At times, it reads more like a journal which may be intentional, but this inconsistency gives the reader, a rather half baked impression.
 <br /> 
 <br /> 3. Author's disagreement with major organizations such as the UN feel like a rant at times, as he only criticizes them without putting forth any concrete suggestions for bigger issues such as infrastructure (development of roads, bridges, dam development, power generation, healthcare &amp; educational programs).
 <br /> 
 <br /> Conclusion:
 <br /> An inspiring book that makes one think about the greater good that can come out of poverty eradication &amp; how we can all be a part of it.
